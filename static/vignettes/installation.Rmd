Please use the following code to install the development branch on GitHub:

```{r install, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

devtools::install_github("xmc811/Scillus", ref = "development")
```

Note:

Errors may occur during the installation of dependency packages. Usually it can be solved by re-installing the relevant packages.
