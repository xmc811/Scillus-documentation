# Scillus

### Seurat wrapper for enhanced processing and visualization of scRNA-seq data

If you want to use Scillus starting from raw data, you should browse all sections below. If you already have a Seurat object constructed by **data integration** and would like to try enhanced plotting functions, you can directly go to [Plotting](vignettes/plotting.html) after installation.

- [Installation of Scillus](vignettes/installation.html)
- [Preparation of configuration files](vignettes/configuration.html)
- [Processing of raw data](vignettes/processing.html)
- [Plotting](vignettes/plotting.html)
